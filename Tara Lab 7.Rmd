```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This: I'm Tara and I'm updating this markdown file here. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gcdf <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action between male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or same difficulty to get)?

Tara: data wrangling and counts

```{r}
get_guns <- gcdf %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns)
```
